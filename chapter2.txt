This blog post goes over all of the work I’ve done to add HD resolution support to 
the Original Xbox version of Halo 2. From patching the game to modifying the hardware 
of the Xbox console to writing custom tools for performance benchmarking, my goal with this
 project was to push the limits of both and see how far I could go. I’ve tried to keep this blog
  post as short as I could and only include the most technically interesting parts but
   even then it ended up quite long.

   this is the true thing.
